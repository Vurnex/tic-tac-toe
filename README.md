# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple game of Tic Tac Toe where the player can make a move and the computer will respond with a move of its own. This project was given as a part of the Odin Project curriculum that I was going through as I worked on it. Most of the code was gathered from a tutorial which is linked below under credits. I did not see the need in trying to recreate something that has already been done many times before, however I did take extensive time in understanding how everything is laid out, the logic/reasoning behind it, and what the code actually does.
